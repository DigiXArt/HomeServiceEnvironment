# HomeServiceEnvironment
This project's aim is to build a service environment using a RaspberryPi and Docker. The documentation includes detailed information about how to set it up and how to run services on it. DigiXArt envisions it as a home-based Platform as a Service (PaaS) that can also serve as an educational collection of tutorial projects on Docker, Golang, Machine Learning, Microservices and more. Please do not use any of these services in production, use these as tutorials and how-tos on various subjects instead.
