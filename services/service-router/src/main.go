SERVICE-ROUTER

service-router is a service that can be used to route requests based on X-TargetService
header.
It is basically a reverse proxy used to route requests to a service without the need to
know about the service's address or port. In this context it is used for services to call
each other by name (X-TargetService header).
This allows us to quickly swap services, redeploy them somewhere else and stuff like that,
without the need of having to reconfigure all other services that rely on them.
Services always call this service with X-TargetService header set, to request the service
they actually need and this service will relay the request and return the response.
Path, request body and headers will be forwarded as well.

main.go
This is the main entrypoint of the service. It starts the service and
starts the reverse proxy.
